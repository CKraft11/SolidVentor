# SolidVentor
SolidWorks UI Configuration file for those used to Autodesk Inventor

As Inventor was the first CAD software I learned, transitioning to SolidWorks I found that the amount of submenus different features and tools were hidden under detrimental to my workflow. So, I decided to create this configuration file arranging features similarly to Inventor as well as some extra dark theme bits. Hope you enjoy!

## Installation

1.
2. Download and double click the file and follow the prompts. If that doesn't work open SolidWorks and go to ```Tools - Save/Restore Settings``` and restore the file from there.
3. Enjoy!
