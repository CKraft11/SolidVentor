# SolidVentor
SolidWorks UI Configuration file for those used to Autodesk Inventor

As Inventor was the first CAD software I learned, transitioning to SolidWorks I found that the amount of submenus different features and tools were hidden under detrimental to my workflow. So, I decided to create this configuration file arranging features similarly to Inventor as well as some extra dark theme bits. Hope you enjoy!

## Installation

1. Close all running SolidWorks instances
2. Download and double click the ```SolidVentor.sldreg``` file and follow the prompts. If that doesn't work open SolidWorks and go to ```Tools - Save/Restore Settings``` and restore the file from there
3. Enjoy!

## Background

As of now I am unsure if the sldreg file can contain images used for the background in SolidWorks so in the mean time here is the image I used. Set the image by going to ```Options - Colors - Background appearance - Image file``` and browse to the image file
